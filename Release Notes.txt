RELEASE NOTES
What to expect in upcoming versions:
Features
Theres a lot of features I need to add, heres the ones on the top of my bucket list, in order of priority:
- Window Snapping (so when expanding an app window, it will never go behind the toolbar)
- Preferences Menu
- Toggle Media Dock Button
- New Custom Toolbar Script (to more easily create toolbars using the current standards
of the toolbar, and to support an automated left-handed mode)
- Left-Handed Mode
- Scale UI Settings
- Toolbar Size Settings
- Collapse Toolbar Option

Icons (pending)
- New Reset, Settings and Save/Load icon paradigms.  Iâ€™m being pretty obsessive over
their design to both fit the aggressively digital aesthetic and make them relatively
easy to understand at a glance.  Still a work in progress

ZBrush (pending)
- Switch the NewDocument button with the ResetDocument button (makes more sense).

0.67:
Mischief
- Updated the toolbar to recognise both the paid and free versions of Mischief 2.0.
- Updated the toolbar to register all the new keybinds, apart from.....
- Due to the way opacity shortcuts now work (with the 0-9 keys instead of an up/down key), the
opacity slider had to be removed.  I'd need to make a custom key type to fix this, so in the
meantime theres nothing I can do sorry :/
- Have an Open button in the mean time?
- Move/Select/Rotate buttons don't have to be held, they select the tool now instead, 
using the new keybinds provided.

0.66:
Touch Profiles
- Added a new profile for the Thinkpad Yoga (thanks to TabletPCReview user thewish).
- Removed the (default) tag, which i'm hoping solves the current Touch Profile bug.

Extra
- Added a new README text file, to instruct users in posting bug reports and fixing the current
touch profile issue.

0.65:
Touch Profiles
- Added a touch profile for the Surface Pro 3, thanks to TabletPCReview user VertPusher.
It should automatically work when using the toolbar with the Surface Pro 3, but if not,
open the script and make it the default touch profile.  Simply remove the "(default)" text
in front of any touch toolbar profile name, and add it to the touch profile of the SP3.

Extra Notes
- Substance Painter after the 1.0 update is less shit on Intel Integrated Graphics, making it
actually kinda usable.  As a result i will try to ensure the toolbar becomes fully featured.

0.64:
ZBrush
- Added Move/Rotate/Scale buttons
- Added Edit/Draw buttons.
- Added Symmetry and Select buttons
- Removed the FocusMask button (I didnt get the shortcut right on that one, >.>)
- I've been using this solidly for a week now and it feels pretty good.  This can be
considered complete apart from the inclusion of a few more important shortcuts
when i find them.  

Substance Painter
- Although it runs like crap on anything with an Intel Integrated Graphics card
(AKA on 98% of all tablets), i've added a preliminary toolbar for the program anyway.
- It mimics the layout of the ZBrush toolbar, which although not perfect, seems to work well.
- Added New/Save/Loaad buttons
- Added Undo/Redo buttons
- Added Camera Control Buttons
- Added Keybind Modifiers (Ctrl/Alt/Shift)
- Added Focus and Symmetry buttons
- Added Draw and Eraser tool buttons
- I recommend you set the PBR quality to low and keep the texture size low in order to
properly use the program.


0.63:
Icons
- Added 11 new buttons, bringing the total button/slider count to 143
- Added new Document buttons
- Added new Object buttons
- Added a new DrawAirbrush button
- Added a new Mask button
- Added new Focus buttons for Polygroups and Masks, plus a Focus Reset button.
- Fixed design issues with the Save and Dynamic Topology buttons.
- Replaced the default toolbar icon with a CHOMP icon.  Snazzy...
- Currently working in some additional 3D Modelling, UI Switch, Selection and 'Digital-Aesthetic'
Load/Save buttons.  Should be availaible in the next release :)

ZBrush
- Fixed issues with the Zoom and Pan buttons, it seems ZBrush is slower than AHK, and as a result
can miss important keybind instructions.  The instructions for these buttons have been repeated
further to ensure the program doesn't miss them.
- Added Focus Mask and Focus Polygroup buttons
- Doesnt seem quite right, ill be working on it... :x

BlackInk
- Switched the Add button with DocumentAdd button.

Krita
- Switched the Add button with DocumentAdd button.
- Replaced button sliders with sliders

Mischief
- Added a DocumentAdd button
- Replaced button sliders with sliders
- Changed the toolbar layout slightly.

MyPaint
- Added a DocumentAdd button.
- Replaced button sliders with sliders

Photoshop
- Replaced button sliders with sliders
- Replaced the Add button with the DocumentAdd button

Substance Designer
- Replaced the Add/Delete buttons with ObjectAdd/Delete buttons
- Changed the toolbar layout slightly


0.62:
Substance Designer
- Switched the Zoom Reset key with the Ctrl key, for selecting multiple objects more easily.
- Added Open/Save icons to the toolbar.

Clip Studio Paint
- Switched Brush size buttons for a slider
- Added Open Button
- Added Shift, Alt and Ctrl buttons
- Added a Focus Document and Focus 1:1 button.

Photoshop
- Fixed the duplicate name issue, stopping users from using the toolbar.

Media Bar
- Ensures the volume increases only by one step for all toolbars, rather than
the two steps it was increasing by on most toolbars.  This may seem slow, but some
headphones do not have very good volume calibration, plus Windows 8 doesn't seem to compensate
for whether headphones or speakers are being used in the volume control, which can cause volume 
numbers as low as 10 to appear loud on a headphone.  This is designed as a precaution to ensure
no-ones ears become damaged upon using volume slider and accidentally turning it up too loud.

Extras
- The release notes you're reading are new!  :OOO

0.61:
Program
- Fixed an issue where the toolbar would scale based on the DPI scaling.  As tablets have
small screens with a high DPI, this is obviously not ideal.  You can now use whatever DPI
feels best on your tablet, and the toolbar scale will not change (thanks Mimi Min!)
