BUGS AND BUG REPORTING
Recently people have been experiencing issues with the script, which i currently don't
have a nice fix for at the moment.  If you get a bug when opening the script, please first
try to set the default touch profile to the tablet model you are using using the text below.  
Regardless however, please either post the issue wherever you downloaded the script (deviantART 
or TabletPCReview), stating your tablet model name (the name like "Surface Pro 3", or 
"Thinkpad Yoga" will do for now, no complex serials or stats plz x_x), and with a screenshot 
of the error window.  This gives me the most amount of information to try and find and 
solve the issue.  Otherwise, it's nearly impossible for me to help you D: 

INSTALL HOTKEY_L
It is extremely important that you install only the latest version of Hotkey_L, not 1.0 or 2.0.
The touch toolbar will only work with this version!

TESTING DIFFERENT TOUCH PROFILES
To do this, right click the "chomp" script, and click 'Edit Script'.  Ensure you are not running
the script before editing it.  Open it in whatever text editor you like.  Scroll down a little
and you'll see the touch profiles listed in order.  Add the text, "(default)" in front of the name of the touch 
profile you would like to use.  Save the script and run it, and see if the issue is fixed.
Whether the issue is fixed or not, please post any bugs you find using the above method, so I can
fix the issue.
